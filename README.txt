Lab Write up:

Aspects:
The important aspects of this lab I thought was the emphasis on testing and how important it is for functions.
In the past when I had coded, testing wasn't emphasized as much and it always came back to bite me so I thought
it was a really good idea that it was emphasized heavily in this lab.  I also enjoyed the more complicated 
algorithms (from last lab) as there were a little bit harder to program and understand; however, they weren't
too bad and I'm looking forward to future labs and harder problems!  

Approach:
I read the manual to begin the lab and drew how I would approach it, order wise, on a paper.
I approached the lab in a pretty standard fashion.  I attempted each function at a time and implemented the test
code for each one as I went along to make sure it would work.  This ensured that I dealt with the problem before
it began to affect the rest of my code (especially in the adjugate function and inverse function as inverse called
adjunct).  After finishing all of the functions and tests, I just made sure that each one worked, uses special matrices
to test each function (to cover all of the special cases).  After this I added my print statement and was done! 
I did not work with anyone on this lab as I'm not close friends with anyone in the class and I probably will
continue to work alone unless I encounter a very hard lab in which if I am unable to finish it with the TA's help
I will seek help from another.  But the TA's are awesome so I doubt that would happen, thanks for all your help!

Conclusion:
The lab ended up working great, I probably could have been much more efficient with my code but thats for me 
to worry about later (haha I'm lazy).  I probably spent about 6 hours on this lab, a lot more than the previous
but still not that much.  I was home sick last weekend so having a relatively simple lab was nice and gave me some
buffer room. I enjoyed coding the functions themselves; however, I didn't enjoy programming the test statements
as those are long and tedious and all very similar.  I thought the lab was great and fits in perfetly with the class.
I thought the hardest part was probably the inverse function as that took me a while to code as there were
so many calculations which had to be done.  The lab manual was great, however a little wordy, maybe cutting those
down would be nice so I could get to work faster! Overall a great lab!
